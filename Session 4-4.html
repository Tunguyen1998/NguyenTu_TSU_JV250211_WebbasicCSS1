        <p>A <b>website</b> (also written as a <b>web site</b>) is one or more <span>web pages</span> and related content that is identified by a common <span>domain name</span> and published on at least one <span>web server</span>. Websites are typically dedicated to a particular topic or purpose, such as news, education, commerce, entertainment, or <span>social media. Hyperlinking</span> between web pages guides the navigation of the site, which often starts with a <span>home page</span>. The <span>most-visited</span> sites are <span>Google, YouTube</span>, and <span>Facebook</span>. </p>
        <p>All publicly-accessible websites collectively constitute the <span>World Wide Web</span>. There are also <span>private websites</span> that can only be accessed on a private network, such as a company's internal website for its employees. <span>Users</span> can access websites on a range of devices, including <span>desktops, laptops, tablets</span>, and <span>smartphones</span>. The <span>app</span> used on these devices is called a <span> web browser</span>.</p>
